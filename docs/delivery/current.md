Mutable #7 status owner. Read for selection/dependency checks and closeout; do not include in the stable execution prefix.

**Most recently completed milestone: [M021 — Reserve one logical operation](../08-backlogs/M021/backlog.md).** State: **Done**. [Package 021](../08-backlogs/M021/spec.md) AC-001–007 passed with deterministic policy + file-backed SQLite/HTTP evidence and zero provider dispatches: concurrent identical identity+payload claims admit one pending reservation, changed payloads conflict (409), equivalent JSON spellings match, expired identities are rejected (410) even after record cleanup, user/global UTC-day allowances (20,000/2,000,000) deny over-capacity (429) without overrun, pre-admission failures leave no record, reservations and the snapshot revision survive restart, and the reviewed additive OpenAPI/TypeScript delta carries the fixed identity wire names with metadata-only records. Its [completion record](../08-backlogs/M021/tasks.md#completion-record) owns the exact evidence. Rows stay `pending` until M022 settlement lands; this slice is not serving.

M019 completed the independent-track enabler for the explicit live provider path required by M015–M018. The bounded access check reached `DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash` with one dispatch through the configured shared credential and returned `deepseek-flash` with known usage and no unresolved reservation; no credential value entered diagnostics or evidence. The same actual key may serve every LinguaDesk operation routed to DeepSeek. Quality, performance, context-limit and production-serving qualification remain unverified; D-19's route-specific providers and longer fallback chains remain later DF-004 work.
